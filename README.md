<strong><i>A programming language where comments are the first-class citizen and ASCII art flowcharts are the controls!</i></strong>
</p>

---

The language comes with epic features like **Parallel Executors** (`threads`), **Algebraic Math Expression** support, and **Coloring**!

_Made as part of the [Lang Jam (`jam0001`)](https://github.com/langjam/jam0001) theme: **first-class comments**._

## Summary

What if all those "`TODO:`" comments and beautiful ASCII art diagrams in your code actually worked? Presenting you the one and only _regretti_, write your _spaghetti_ and _forgetti_!

> _Basically, I took the theme "literally"!_

So comments are **commands**!
